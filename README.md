# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase selected projects, work experience, and academic background.

The goal of this site is to provide a clear overview of what I have built and what I am currently working on.

## Live Website
https://pabbathi-dev.vercel.app/

## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel

## What it includes
- Project summaries with links to live demos
- Work experience
- Education
- Downloadable CV

## Purpose
I built this portfolio to present my work in a structured and accessible way. It focuses on clarity, responsiveness, and clean layout rather than heavy animations or visual effects.

The codebase is structured with reusable components and a mobile-first approach.
